# DSL: AshGraphql.Domain

The entrypoint for adding graphql behavior to an Ash domain


## graphql
Global configuration for graphql




### Examples
```
graphql do
  authorize? false # To skip authorization for this domain
end

```




### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Docs |
|------|------|---------|------|
| [`authorize?`](#graphql-authorize?){: #graphql-authorize? } | `boolean` | `true` | Whether or not to perform authorization for this domain |
| [`tracer`](#graphql-tracer){: #graphql-tracer } | `atom` |  | A tracer to use to trace execution in the graphql. Will use `config :ash, :tracer` if it is set. |
| [`root_level_errors?`](#graphql-root_level_errors?){: #graphql-root_level_errors? } | `boolean` | `false` | By default, mutation errors are shown in their result object's errors key, but this setting places those errors in the top level errors list |
| [`error_handler`](#graphql-error_handler){: #graphql-error_handler } | `mfa` | `{AshGraphql.DefaultErrorHandler, :handle_error, []}` | Set an MFA to intercept/handle any errors that are generated. |
| [`show_raised_errors?`](#graphql-show_raised_errors?){: #graphql-show_raised_errors? } | `boolean` | `false` | For security purposes, if an error is *raised* then Ash simply shows a generic error. If you want to show those errors, set this to true. |
